#This is a set of problems with solutions to code each one using python programming language and hostnames defined in pyhton dictionary

Problem 1: Use a for statement and random.randrange to print 10 random integers between 25 and 35. 
Problem 2: Use random.randrange to print an odd integer between 0 and 100. 

Problem 3: Use random.choice to select a day of the week from a list and print that day. 
The Math Module 
This module provides access to the mathematical functions. You can find all of the math functions here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#module-math 
Use it to:
calculate trigonometric functions 
calculate logarithmic functions 
Access mathematical constants 

Problem 4:  Search on the internet for a way to calculate an approximation for pi. There are many that use simple arithmetic. Write a program to compute the approximation and then print that value as well as the value of math.pi from the math module. 

Problem 5: Search the internet for how to convert radians to degrees. Write a program to compute the conversion given a user input value. Print this value as well as the calculated value using the degrees function in the math module. 

Problem 6: Use a for statement to calculate the factorial of a user input value. Print this value as well as the calculated value using the factorial function in the math module. # Module6
Problems 1-6
